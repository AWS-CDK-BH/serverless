# The Predictive Lambda Pattern

This is a pattern that uses a container inside Lambda to deploy a custom Python ML model to predict the nearest Chipotle restaurant based on your lat/long.

## What's Included In This Pattern?
This pattern uses sklearn to create a custom k nearest neighbour model to predict the nearest Chipotle to a given Latitude and Longitude. The model is deployed inside a container attached to AWS Lambda.

### The ML Model
This is a very simple model to demonstrate the concept (I didn't even check the accuracy because it doesn't change the pattern). The data for this came from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffreybraun/chipotle-locations) and it uses [sklearn nearest neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) to predict the closest Chipotle location to a given lat/long

### Two Docker Containers
I use the Lambda image to train the ML model in one container and then I use a separate container for the deployed Lambda Function. The reason I do this is because it means that you know you have pickled your model in the same environment it will be deployed but you can use things that wont be packaged into your deployed function keeping it as lightweight as possible. You will also have a built container image containing the raw data, the training logic and the trained model. These images could be archived to have a history of your model.

## A Lambda Function
I have this setup with a 15 second timeout and 4GB ram to comfortably run our model

## An API Gateway HTTP API
Setup as a proxy integration, all requests hit the Lambda Function

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
